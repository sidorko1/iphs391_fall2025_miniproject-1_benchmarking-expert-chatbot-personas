Turn-Level Chatbot Persona Evaluation Rubric (0–100)

Persona: [INSERT DESCRIPTION]
Conversation: [INSERT 10-turn conversation here]

Step 1: Evaluate Each Turn (1–10)

Score each turn individually across these categories:

Category	Behavioral Indicators / Observable Metrics	Turn Score (0–100)
Alignment	- Personality, tone, and worldview consistent with persona
- Language, phrasing, and attitude match persona	100 = fully aligned
70 = mostly aligned
50 = partially aligned
0 = off-persona
Responsiveness & Adaptability (Recovery Included)	- Responds to user confusion, pushback, or topic changes
- Escalates/de-escalates tone as needed
- Recovery: corrects prior mistakes or off-topic responses
- Penalize repeated errors or slow adaptation	100 = fully responsive + recovers
70 = mostly responsive; partial recovery
50 = minimal responsiveness; slow/incomplete recovery
0 = ignores input or fails to recover
Knowledge Accuracy & Depth	- Factual correctness per turn
- Quality of reasoning, domain expertise, and persona-specific knowledge
- Extra credit for particularly deep or nuanced insight	100 = fully correct, expert-level reasoning
70 = mostly correct; minor gaps
50 = some correct info, reasoning weak
0 = mostly incorrect or misleading
Goal-Directedness & Objective Achievement	- Does the turn advance persona’s main objective (teach, motivate, persuade)?
- Tracks overall conversation completion: Did the bot achieve the persona goal by the end?
- Includes positivity, encouragement, assertiveness, or humor as persona-appropriate	100 = fully goal-directed and achieves objective
70 = mostly aligned with minor lapses
50 = partially aligned; objective not fully achieved
0 = irrelevant; fails objective
Creativity / Style	- Memorable phrasing, metaphors, humor, or storytelling consistent with persona
- Extra credit for clever or novel expressions	100 = highly creative, memorable, extra clever
70 = moderately creative
50 = some creativity
0 = flat or off-tone
Engagement / Persuasiveness	- Captures user attention
- Uses hooks, rhetorical devices, motivational phrasing
- Extra credit for seamless multi-turn engagement or novel persona strategies	100 = highly engaging, multi-turn flow
70 = moderately engaging
50 = minimally engaging
0 = flat or disengaging

Step 2: Deductions (Cumulative)

Factual errors, off-topic, or ignored input: cumulative −1 to −5 points per instance per conversation, rather than over-penalizing one-off lapses

Minor lapses naturally absorbed; only repeated or severe errors reduce score meaningfully

Step 3: Factor Weighting Based on Persona Type
Persona Type	Weight Adjustments
Motivator	+0.05 Engagement & Persuasiveness, −0.05 Knowledge Accuracy
Expert	+0.05 Knowledge Accuracy, −0.05 Engagement & Persuasiveness
Entertainer	+0.05 Creativity & Style, −0.05 Knowledge Accuracy

Base Weights:

Factor	Weight
Alignment	0.25
Responsiveness & Adaptability	0.20
Knowledge Accuracy & Depth	0.15
Goal-Directedness & Objective Achievement	0.15
Creativity / Style	0.10
Engagement / Persuasiveness	0.15

Adjust weights per persona type as indicated.

Step 4: Compute Factor Scores

Average each factor across all 10 turns.

Apply cumulative deductions for errors or off-topic behavior.

Multiply by adjusted weights.

Sum for final persona quality score (0–100).

Step 5: Scoring Guidelines (Quantitative)
Weighted Score	Interpretation
90–100	≥90% of turns aligned, responsive, goal-directed; persona objective achieved; minimal errors; extra credit may push above 95
70–89	Mostly aligned; minor lapses in responsiveness, creativity, or goal-directedness; some recovery opportunities missed
50–69	Inconsistent; factual errors, flat/off-topic responses, or incomplete recovery from mistakes
<50	Majority of turns off-persona, unresponsive, irrelevant, or fails to achieve persona objectives

Step 6: Extra Credit Opportunities

Highly clever metaphors/storytelling: +2–5 points

Seamless multi-turn engagement: +2–5 points

Novel strategies showing deep persona understanding: +2–5 points

Successful recovery from prior mistakes or off-topic responses: +1–3 points per turn

This version is:

Turn-level and quantitative

Tracks factual correctness & reasoning explicitly

Measures persona goal achievement separately under Goal-Directedness
