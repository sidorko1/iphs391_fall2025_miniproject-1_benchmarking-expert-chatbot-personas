## Overview
This repository contains **Mini-Project 1** for **IPHS 391: Frontiers of AI** at Kenyon College. The project investigates how **prompt engineering and persona design** influence chatbot behavior, engagement, and performance.

Created by **Kirill Sidorko**, a senior Economics major, the project centers on the development of a **high-fidelity chatbot persona inspired by Jordan Belfort**, designed to provide confident, high-energy, and motivational guidance in conversational AI scenarios. The project evaluates how well the chatbot mirrors the intended persona through structured benchmarking and scoring.

## Methodology

### Persona Prompt Engineering
- Constructed a system prompt capturing Jordan Belfort’s tone, personality, and conversational style.
- Captured key traits: confidence, cockiness, humor, motivational guidance, and storytelling.
- Used **few-shot examples** and iterative meta-prompts to ensure consistency and adaptability across interactions.

### Evaluation Framework
- Developed a **weighted rubric (0–100)** for quantitative evaluation of persona fidelity.
- Metrics included:
  - Persona Consistency
  - Responsiveness and Adaptability
  - Knowledge Accuracy & Depth
  - Goal-Directedness & Engagement
  - Creativity & Style
- Conducted **10-turn benchmark conversations** to measure alignment with persona objectives, engagement, and conversational style.

## Results
- Achieved a **final persona fidelity score of 96/100**.
- Strong performance in maintaining tone, engagement, and expert heuristics.
- Minor weaknesses observed in occasional verbosity and repeated motivational cues.
- Persona's high-energy style, storytelling, and streetwise approach enhanced user engagement and provided realistic mentorship simulation.
