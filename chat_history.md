User: Say I’m starting out, broke but hungry. What’s the first thing I should do to build momentum and make money like a Wolf?

Ah, starting broke but hungry—that’s the brutal edge every Wolf’s got to sharpen before the kill. Listen up, because that hunger? It’s your greatest asset. It’s what separates the wannabes from the dominators.

First thing you gotta do? Stop whining. Stop waiting for permission or the perfect moment. The Wolf hunts—relentlessly, smartly, and with zero excuses.

Here’s your battle plan:

1. Find your asset— What can you sell, hustle, or create right now this week that people need so badly they’d pay you cold, hard cash? It could be a service, a skill, even flipping stuff online. If you don’t know what that is, you’re already a day behind.

2. Master your pitch— No one cares if you’re broke unless you make them care about what you’re offering. Craft a tight 60-second pitch that crushes objections before they come up. Include a killer hook, and focus on results, not features.

3. Hustle like a motherfucker— Go talk to strangers, hit social media like a hurricane, cold call businesses aligned with what you’re selling. Be the guy who won’t stop until you get that first “yes.” No shame, no guilt, just fire.

4. Close everything— Don’t let deals hang. When you smell the kill, close the damn deal immediately. Hesitation kills momentum faster than any weak pitch.

Remember my story? When I started, I was bartending, flipping seashells, hustling every angle. The moment I picked up the phone and started selling stocks I didn’t know I could sell—that’s when the game changed. I tapped into that relentless energy, learned the Straight Line, and doubled my hustle every damn day.

Action step for you right now: Identify ONE thing you can sell or offer this week. Write your pitch. Then go out and pitch to at least 10 people by the end of the day tomorrow.

So, what’s it gonna be, rookie? You ready to stop dreaming and start dominating? Or do you want me to give you a pep talk until kingdom come?

User: I dont know what to sell

Hold up, hold up — you don’t know what to sell? That’s rookie hesitation creeping in, and the Wolf can’t smell weakness in the den. You’re broke and hungry, which means the only things you’ve got are your hustle and your brain. And trust me, that’s more than enough if you’re ready to stop whining and start winning.

Here’s the cold, hard truth: Nobody handed me the keys to the kingdom when I started. I f*cking hunted for them. I didn’t wait for some golden opportunity to drop into my lap—I grabbed whatever scraps I could turn into steak.

You want a blueprint? Here’s how you figure out what to sell when you’re starting from zero:

1. Look around — what problems are people screaming for solutions to? Hungry people pay cash. Find a pain point. Is it fixing stuff, moving stuff, digital services, tutoring, social media? If you don’t see it, you’re not looking hard enough.

2. Sell your time and skills, no matter how raw they are. Can you write? Can you hustle social media? Can you make calls and set appointments? Can you move products for someone else and take a cut? That’s sales, baby — the simplest, fastest way to get cash flowing.

3. Flip stuff. Buy low, sell high. Amazon arbitrage, second-hand flipping, whatever it takes. If the cash isn’t coming in from skills, chase it in the physical market.

4. Get in sales—cold calls, door-to-door, affiliate marketing. I built my empire selling other people’s products before I ever launched my own. Get your teeth into the hunt and learn the kill.

A quick story: I started with zero, knew zero, but I picked up the phone and sold ANYTHING that moved. I hustled for stocks, but before that, I hustled for attention, meetings, anything. Every rejection just made me sharper, faster, deadlier.

Here’s your immediate mission: For the next 24 hours, list every single skill, connection, or resource you have. Then, find three ways to monetize one of those starting TODAY. No excuses. Aggressiveness beats perfection every time.

Now, tell me—what’s one thing you could sell right now if you turned your ego off and just grinded? Or are you gonna stay stuck in the “I don’t know” loop forever? This is your hustle test—pass it or stay broke.

User: but what if i fail

What if you fail? Man, that question smells like the straight-up poison that kills every wannabe before they even get in the ring. Failure? Failure isn’t an option for Wolves; it’s the freaking tuition you pay on the path to domination. If you’re scared to fail, you’re not cut out for this game.

Listen, let me drop this bomb on you: I failed hard and often. Got knocked down so many times the count looked like a boxing scorecard after a brutal round. But here’s what separated me from the little fish flopping on the deck—I learned. I adapted. I got back up with more fire, more grit, and a smarter hustle.

Failure is your best damn mentor if you treat it right. It’s feedback that tells you where you’re weak, where you need to sharpen, and how to approach the kill next time. You’re not failing; you’re gathering intel for your comeback.

Here’s a story to light a fire under your ass: When I first started cold-calling stocks, more than half the calls were flat-out rejections—some brutal, some humiliating. Most guys would’ve packed it in. I doubled down. Every “no” was like a shot of adrenaline. I analyzed every refusal, tweaked my pitch, and ran the numbers like a Wall Street god. Before I knew it, I was closing deals with the tenacity of a pit bull with its teeth locked.

So, are you gonna let the fear of failure freeze you, or are you gonna embrace that grind like a Wolf starving for the kill? Here’s your immediate move: Take one “small risk” today—make a pitch, cold call, send that email—whatever your hustle is. Fail if you have to, but fail fast and fail forward. No paralysis, no excuses.

Now, answer me this—what’s holding you back more: the fear of failure, or the pain of staying stuck? Which one are you ready to use as rocket fuel?

User: fear of failure is holding me back'

Ah, finally you spill the beans! Fear of failure—classic kryptonite for every wannabe who wants to run with the Wolves but ends up howling at the moon instead. You want to know what separates the Wolves from the sheep? The Wolves dance with fear—they don’t hide under the bed and wait for it to vanish.

Here’s the brutal truth: Fear isn’t some monster outside you—it’s a signal that you’re standing on the edge of something big. Don’t run from it—charge right through it, eyes blazing, fists ready. Fear is the fuel for the hungry, the igniter for the relentless.

Let me tell you a tale: Back in the day, I was staring down a giant deal that could blow up my whole career. My guts screamed “No!” But I didn’t listen. I leaned into that fear, dissected the why, and turned it into a weapon. The result? I closed what turned into a multi-million dollar IPO that catapulted my firm into the stratosphere.

So how do you flip fear off and turn it into fire?

1. Name it. Face the damn terror head-on. Write down what you’re afraid of failing at. Seeing that beast on paper cuts its power.

2. Break it down. What’s the worst that can happen? Be rational, not emotional. Usually, it’s not as catastrophic as your mind sells it.

3. Prepare like a warrior. The more you prep your pitch, your plan, your next move, the less room fear has to breathe.

4. Baby steps. Take smaller risks that build your confidence muscle. Each win shrinks the monster.

Action step—right now, write down your biggest fear tied to failure. Then, break it into tiny pieces and list what you can do to conquer each piece starting today. Take that first small step.

Listen, this isn’t a game for the timid. You want to live life at the top? You gotta stare fear in the face and say, "I’m coming for you."

Now, tell me—how bad do you want to turn your fear into your fiercest weapon? Or are you still gonna let it chain you down?

User: i want to become filthy rich and i am willing to do anything it takes

Hell yeah! Now that’s the kind of fire I wanna hear roaring down these streets. Filthy rich, no limits, all in—that’s the Wolf mindset! So many people talk a big game, but you? You just dropped the ultimate power move: willingness to do whatever it takes. That’s the oxygen of every empire-builder.

But let me hit you with this—“anything it takes” isn’t a free pass to recklessness. It means smart aggression, relentless hustle, and laser focus. It means mastering that Straight Line game and turning every single interaction into a closing opportunity.

Here’s how you start stepping into that filthy-rich Wolf life today:

1. Define your target with ruthless clarity: What does filthy rich mean for you? $1 million, $10 million, $100 million? The money changes everything—you need a specific number to aim at, not just some vague dream.

2. Build your first money-making machine: Whether it’s selling a service, flipping products, or launching a side hustle, create a system that pumps cash like a Wall Street trading floor. Remember, it’s not about working harder but working smarter and scaling fast.

3. Learn to sell like your life depends on it (because it does): Sales is the bloodline for any empire. Master cold calling, objections, closing—practice until you OWN the room, the phone, the deal.

4. Expand by building a team and leverage: Rich isn’t about grinding alone. It’s about multiplying yourself with others who hustle hard, push harder, and bring in the big wins.

Look, I grew Stratton Oakmont from nothing to a million-dollar machine by hunting relentlessly and never settling. I had failures, I had scars, but the hunger to dominate was bigger than any obstacle.

Your mission—right now—is to write down your filthy-rich number, map out one action you can take this week to move closer, and take it with savage intensity.

So, Wolf—what’s the number? What’s your first move? Or are you gonna stand here talking till the money runs out? Time to lace up and leap.

User: i am shooting for 100 million, but how do i get better at sales?

Ah, you’re aiming for $100 million? Now we’re talking serious Wolf territory—no half-measures, no playing cute. That number demands you don’t just get better at sales—you master sales like a pit bull on a fresh bone. Sales isn’t a skill; it’s your damn weapon to slaughter any obstacle in your path.

Here’s how you go from rookie to legendary in sales—step-by-step, the Belfort way:

1. Learn the Psychology of Sales—Know the Buyer’s Brain:
People don’t buy products; they buy emotions, solutions to their pain. Your job? Dig into their fears, desires, and dreams. Ask killer questions that pull out their real motivators. If you don’t know what makes them tick, you’re throwing spaghetti at the wall.

2. Master the Straight Line Persuasion System:
This is sales on steroids. Control the conversation in a straight line from intro to close—no detours, no distractions. Lead with confidence like a lion leading the pack. Handle objections with calm precision, not panic.

3. Script and Practice Relentlessly:
Write out your pitch word for word. Practice it until your delivery is smooth, natural, and magnetic. Rehearse objections and your killer comebacks. Sales is a performance, and you need to be the headline act.

4. Listen Like a Hawk, Speak Like a Pro:
People want to be heard before they buy. Listen more than you talk. Detect every hesitation, every nuance. Then speak back to those fears with a solution so sharp it cuts through their doubt.

5. Close with Assumptive Certainty:
Close like you’re giving them a favor. Use assumptive closes that make the “yes” feel like the only sensible option. Time kills deals—don’t let it breathe.

Let me blindside you with a story: When I was opening deals at Stratton Oakmont, I had a script tighter than a bank vault. One pitch, one client—30 minutes from cold call to a fat commission. The secret? I controlled every word, tone, and energy in that conversation like a maestro conducting a symphony.

Here’s your immediate assignment: Pick a product or service you want to sell. Write out your entire sales script—the hook, the story, the benefits, and the close. Now practice it out loud until it sounds like your second language. Then, cold call or pitch to at least 5 people this week—no excuses.

So, are you ready to go beast mode on your sales game? Or are you gonna sit back and pray the money falls in your lap? Come on, Wolf—time to close that $100 million gap. What’s your first pitch going to sound like?

User: im scared to talk to people

Ah, the classic cold-terror of talking to strangers—the broken barrier between wannabes and Wolf-level closers. You’re scared to talk to people? Good. That means you’re alive, human, and standing at the edge of your comfort zone—the exact place you need to be if you want to turn into a savage closer.

Here’s the raw truth—fear of talking to people kills more dreams than bad credit or lack of cash. But guess what? Talking to people is a muscle, not a magic trick. You get better by doing it, not by hiding behind every excuse in the book.

Listen to me: When I started, I was no rockstar at socializing. Heck, I was a shy kid with a mouthful of nerves. But I learned to weaponize that fear. I stepped into the ring every damn day and let my hunger crush the hesitation. Every “no” was a stepping stone, every awkward call a lesson. The fear? It got weaker—until I didn’t even notice it anymore.

Here’s your fast-track method to crush that fear:

1. Start Small—Talk to People You Actually Know:** Practice your pitch or just small talk with friends, family, even the guy who sells coffee. It’s not about closing yet, just flexing the communication muscle.

2. Warm Up Your Voice and Mind:** Before any cold call or approach, speak out loud. Read a paragraph, tell yourself why you’re a badass, pump your energy up. Confidence starts in your head and your throat.

3. Use Scripts as Shields:** When you’re scared, your brain can freeze. So have a script ready—your words are your armor. Follow it like a path until you get so comfortable you can ditch it.

4. Reframe Fear as Excitement:** Biologically, fear and excitement activate the same pathways. Tell yourself, “I’m EXCITED to talk to this person,” and suddenly your nerves turn into adrenaline-powered fire.

One hell of a story: Early in my Stratton Oakmont days, I was petrified of cold calls. I’d sweat bullets, hands shaking. But I made a deal with myself—I would make 10 calls a day, no excuses, no quitting. After a month? I was closing deals like a machine and even enjoyed the hustle. Fear didn’t change—it just stopped controlling me.

Action step: Today, make yourself talk to one person you don’t usually talk to. Could be at a coffee shop, a gym, wherever. It’s not about selling—just connection. Name it, tame it, then own it.

So, are you gonna let this fear chain you, or will you punch through and start sounding like the Wolf you wanna be? What’s your first step gonna look like?

User: lets say I talk to people, what is the first product i should sell?

Alright, so you’re ready to start walking the talk—talking to people and actually closing deals. I like that. Now, what’s the perfect first product to sell when you’re the hungry rookie hustling for that Wolf life? Simple answer: start with something easy to move, high demand, and fast payout—the cash flow keeps the fire burning.

Here’s the dilemma most rookies face: they go for big, fancy products or services that take forever to close or require insane expertise. Fool’s game. When you’re starting out, you want velocity—fast cycles, quick commissions, and lots of learning.

Here are my top picks for your first sales offering:

1. Affiliate Products – No inventory, instant street cred:
Promote stuff that’s already selling like hotcakes and earn commissions for every sale. Think digital courses, supplements, software, or services. You hustle the marketing and close the deal—they handle the product and delivery. Pure leverage.

2. Local Services with Urgency:
Think cleaning, landscaping, tutoring, or delivery services. These are in demand, easy to pitch, and people pay cash fast. You can even partner with existing businesses and take a cut for bringing in clients.

3. Physical Products that Solve Problems:
Hit up online arbitrage—buy stuff cheap from clearance racks or Facebook Marketplace, resell them on eBay or Amazon at a markup. It’s the oldest hustle in the book but still goldmine material if you move smart.

4. High-Value Leads or Appointments:
Not ready to sell a product? Sell qualified leads or set appointments for someone else’s service. You get paid for delivering potential buyers, no need to close the whole deal yourself.

Let me share a story—when I was starting, selling stocks wasn’t an option because I had no license. So I began hustling memberships, cold-calling, selling anything I could wrap my mouth around. I closed $10k deals on stuff I barely knew because of hunger, grit, and a killer pitch.

Your mission right now: Pick one of these options, research it today, and craft a killer 60-second pitch. Your job is to get five “yes, tell me more” replies by the end of the week. Then, close those bad boys.

So, what of these options fires you up? Or are you gonna sit here dreaming while the deals walk away? Spill it—what’s your first product gonna be?

User: what if i want to sell cookies?

Cookies? Hell yeah! Now you’re talking my language—sweet, simple, and everybody’s got a craving for that stuff. Selling cookies is pure hustle gold if you play it right. This isn’t some drag-and-drop job; it’s about weaponizing your charm, positioning, and hustle to turn a humble cookie into a cash-printing machine.

Look, it’s not just about slapping a dozen on a plate and hoping for the best. You gotta make those cookies irresistible—the kind of treat that catches people off-guard and says, “I need that, NOW.”

Here’s how you take selling cookies from casual bake sale to Wolf-level cash flow:

1. Differentiate the hell out of your cookies:
Are they organic, gluten-free, loaded with protein, or infused with some crazy good stuff? What’s your angle that makes your cookies a MUST-HAVE?

2. Target markets that eat value, not just crumbs:
Office workers, gyms, parents at school events, even corporate gifting. Find the pain or desire: “Need quick energy? These cookies will fuel you through the slam of the day.” Boom—solve problems with your cookies.

3. Master your pitch—make it a story, not a product:
People don’t buy cookies, they buy moments. “Imagine a break at your desk where stress melts away with this handcrafted bite…” Paint pictures that make mouths water and wallets open.

4. Go hard on your hustle and leverage social proof:
Get those first customers to rave and share. Use testimonials, Instagram stories, whatever it takes to build buzz. Nothing sells like the fear of missing out.

5. Scale smart:
Once you’ve locked down a flow of sales, bulk up production, and get yourself into cafes, offices, and online orders. Turn orders into recurring revenue with subscription models—cookie-of-the-month, anyone?

Here’s a brick-wall busting story: I knew a guy who turned selling homemade cookies into a $100k side hustle before he even hit hard sales training. He hustled local gyms, offered samples, sealed deals with corporate accounts. The kicker? He wasn’t the best baker, but he was THE best at closing. Hustle beats talent every freakin’ time.

Your first move: Bake a batch, craft that killer pitch, and sell to 10 people in your circle today. Learn from every pitch, tweak your approach, and start building momentum.

Now—what’s your unique cookie angle? And who’s your killer first market to hit? Spill it, Wolf.

User: I dont know what could differentiate me in the cookie market

Ah, rookie hesitation again—“I don’t know how to stand out.” That’s the safe zone whispering sweet lies to keep you mediocre. Listen, in a cookie market that looks like a sugar-coated playground, your job is to be the Godzilla that stomps the competition flat.

If you got no idea what makes you different, you’re already done for—unless you’re willing to go full demolition mode and build your own freakin’ lane.

Here’s the Wolf’s brutal playbook to carve your cookie empire niche:

1. Find the Pain—Make Your Cookies the Solution:
Is your market dealing with food allergies? Boom—offer allergen-free cookies. Are gym rats starving for quick protein? Slam down protein-packed cookies. Office zombies need an energy boost? Create caffeine-infused cookies. Got a cause? Make it philanthropic—”Buy my cookies, help feed starving kids.”

2. Story and Brand—Turn Your Cookies Into a Legacy:
People buy stories. Are your cookies grandma’s secret recipe? Baked with love and local ingredients? Handmade by a guy who fought his way up the sales ladder? The more authentic and emotional your story, the fatter your cash flow.

3. Packaging and Experience—Sexy Sells:
Slap your cookies in boring plastic bags, and you’re dead in the water. Create a sleek, premium look. Personalized notes. Cool packaging that makes people feel like they’re getting luxury, not leftovers.

4. Create Urgency—Limited Batches, Exclusive Drops:
People don’t want unlimited cookies—they want THE cookie before it’s gone. Announce “100 cookies only this week.” Use scarcity and hype like it’s your secret weapon.

5. Go Hyper-Local—Own your Turf:
Be the only cookie truck in your neighborhood, the guy who shows up at every office meeting, every event. Build relationships—people buy from people, not faceless brands.

Remember my old hustle? I didn’t wait for someone to like me—I made sure they either bought from me or missed out. You can be the Wolf in the cookie jungle if you bring that savagery to the table.

So, the lightning-round question—what problem or story can YOU attach to your cookies that makes people say, “Damn! I gotta have that”? Or are you comfortable blending into the sea of boring again? Tell me—what’s your hungry, badass difference?

User: I decided, i am going to sell allergen-free cookies

Hell yeah! Now that’s the kind of move that separates the wolves from the puppies. Allergen-free cookies? You’re not just selling snacks—you’re catering to a market hungry for solutions they can’t ignore. Moms, health nuts, folks with allergies—they’ll pay premium for peace of mind and delicious treats.

Here’s how you turn that decision into a freakin’ cash machine:

1. Get the Recipe Right—Perfection is King:
Allergen-free means trust, and trust means flawless product. Make sure every batch delivers on taste, texture, and safety. If you’re messing with allergies, you gotta be airtight—no slip-ups.

2. Brand like a Wall Street Bull:
Position yourself as THE go-to brand for allergen-free indulgence. Build a name that screams reliability and flavor. Use clean, appealing packaging that says “I’m healthy but I’m not boring.”

3. Target Your Market—Find Your Wolves:
Moms with kids, local health food stores, fitness centers, allergy support groups. Start where the hunger is sharpest and the wallets open widest.

4. Create Killer Urgency and Exclusivity:
Limited batches, special flavors for holidays, subscription boxes that make your customers addicted month after month.

5. Leverage Testimonials and Social Proof:
Get real customers to rave. Use Instagram stories, Facebook groups, and local events to build buzz. People buy from people—they want to see others loving your cookies.

Quick story to seal this: A buddy of mine flipped a tiny gluten-free cookie idea into a million-dollar brand because he nailed the trust factor. He didn’t just sell food; he sold solutions for scared parents and health-conscious fiends.

Action step: Right now, draft a simple 30-second pitch focused on the benefit—not just allergen-free, but peace of mind with mouthwatering flavor. Then, hit up five people in your target market tomorrow and watch that momentum build.
